                        <p><strong>Intro to websites</strong></p>
						<p>Hi everybody and welcome to the first step of this webquest that will help you build your first website !&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Let's start with the simplest and yet most important question:</p>
						<p><em>How does a website work ?</em></p>
						<p>No don't hesitate to ask yourself questions because you may think they are "stupid".</p>
						<p>We have to ask ourselves those questions before we start the website creation !</p>
						<p>I'm sure you go everyday to the web and see all kinds of pages.</p>
						<p>For that you have to launch a browser which in most cases will be represented by one of those icons below:</p>
                        <img alt="browsers" src="images/chapter1img1.png">
						<p>With this browser you can consult any kind of pages here is an exemple of wikipedia:</p>
                        <img alt="browsers" src="images/chapter1img2.png">
						<p>I'm sure you are used to use a browser everyday but are you really sure to know <strong>how web works and how to create such pages ?&nbsp;</strong></p>
						<p><em>I heard of html/css does this has something related to websites ?</em>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Indeed !</p>
						<p>Those are computer languages that allows someone to create websites, every website is based on those languages and they are universal today.</p>
						<p>They are the roots of the web. <strong>HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee back in 1991 at CERN</strong></p>
						<p>Tim still follows the evolution of the web he created the World Wide Web Consortium (w3c) who defines the new versions oflanguages linked to the web.</p>
						<p>He also created more recently the world wide web foundation who analyses and follow the evolution of the web.</p>
						<p><em>Don't misunderstand Web and internet, Internet is the bigger set the one that containes the web the emails and so on, </em></p>
						<p><em>Tim is therefore not the inventor of the internet</em></p>
						<p>The languages HTML and CSS are again the root for every website.</p>
						<p>When you consult a website with your browser you have to know that on the back the browser works out the code to allow the page you want to see to be displayed correctly.</p>
						<p>The computer bases iteself on the HTML and CSS code the programmer told him and finds out how to display the webpage as you can see on the image below:</p>
                        <img alt="browsers" src="images/chapter1img3.png">
						<p>HTML and CSS are two languages that one need to know in order to create webpages.</p>
						<p>The browser will do the translation between those two languages and what you will see on the screen.</p>
						<p>You are probably wondering why do you need to know those two languages ?</p>
						<p>Let's continue and find out !&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>HTML and CSS</strong></p>
						<p>To create a web site we need to provide to the computer instructions, it's not enough just to type texts that should appear on the website (like one would do on word for instance) you also have to tell the computer where to put the text insert images make links between pages and so on</p>
						<p><strong>The roles of html and css</strong></p>
						<p>To explain to the computer what you want to do you will need to use a language he understands.</p>
						<p>That's where things get tricky as you will have to learn two languages</p>
						<p><em>Why two languages ? One would be enough right ?</em>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>You must be asking that to learn and understand two languages will be double the complexity and twice as much time to learn&hellip; <strong>but it's not true !</strong></p>
						<p>Those two languages are here to facilitate things because they complete each other:</p>
						<p><strong>HTML</strong>&nbsp;<em>(hypertext markup language)</em>: was created back in 1991 when the web was launched. His role is to organise the content. It's therefore in HTML that you will write what needs to appear on the page: texts, links, images&hellip;</p>
						<p><strong>CSS</strong>&nbsp;<em>(Cascading Style Sheets)</em>: the role of CSS is to handle the appearance of the web page (position, style, colours, etc&hellip;) that language came up in 1996 to complete the HTML</p>
						<p><strong>Info</strong>: you may have also heard of the XHTML, it's a variation of the HTML that is more rigourous and can be a bit more complicated to handle, in our course we will work on the latest version of HTML (HTML 5) which is the language that today everybody is inclined to use</p>
						<p>You can create websites only using HTML but it won't be very pretty that's why you need to use CSS to complete your website.</p>
						<p>To give you an idea the picture below shows you a website with and without CSS</p>
                        <img alt="browsers" src="images/chapter1img4.png">
						<p><em>HTML defines the content. CSS allows to make the content pretty :)</em></p>
						<p>As you understood the CSS needs an HTML page to work this is why we will first learn HTML, your first page won't be pretty but it won't be long until they do.</p>
						<p><em>What softawre will i need to create my website ?!</em></p>
						<p>Even though there is tons of software to do so we will create our website using the most complicated one which is&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Notepad !</p>
						<img alt="browsers" src="images/chapter1img5.png">
						<p>Yes indeed this software will be able to help you create your own pages in a very simple way :)</p>
						<p>Don't forget to use a browser to display your webpage during this course, I recommend to use google chrome but any browser will do !</p>
						<p>Let's sum up what we have seen so far:</p>
						<ul>
						    <li>The web was invented by Tim Burners-Lee in 1991 at CERN</li>
						    <li>To create webpages we need two languages:</li>
						    <li>HTML: for the content</li>
						    <li>CSS: to make it pretty</li>
						    <li>The browser is a software that allows to see webpages by translating the code into attractive information</li>
						    <li>In that course we will learn how to use a simple notepad to create our very own webpage</li>
						</ul>
